<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>Every interactive piece of software must have some form of <strong>input validation </strong>and <strong>error handling </strong>to maintain a proper user experience and prevent crashes. In this stage, we are going to handle errors and validate user input and equations.</p>
<p>There's one thing in our program that can hamper its execution. It is a user-provided equation. Let's establish a set of guidelines for our program.</p>
<ol>
<li>An equation cannot begin with an operator (<code class="java">+</code>, <code class="java">/</code>, and so on);</li>
<li>An equation cannot end with an operator;</li>
<li>An operator cannot directly follow another operator (for example, <code class="java">2+-3</code>);</li>
<li>Division by zero is forbidden.</li>
</ol>
<p>The cases described above should be handled in the following way:</p>
<ol>
<li>No character should be added to the <code class="java">EquationLabel</code> if users try to enter an operator as the first character;</li>
<li>Provide visual feedback to users if the equation ends with an operator. Change the font color of the <code class="java">EquationLabel</code> with the help of <code class="java">Colors.RED.darker()</code> after the <code class="java">Equals</code> button has been clicked;</li>
<li>If two operators are inserted consecutively, then the second operator should replace the first;</li>
<li>Similar to the second case, once the <code class="java">Equals</code> button has been clicked, change the color of the <code class="java">EquationLabel</code> if the equation contains division by zero. </li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>In this stage, you should: </p>
<ol>
<li>Properly format and validate input expressions;</li>
<li>Maintain the names of the interface components (<code class="java">JLabels</code> and <code class="java">JButtons</code>) from the previous stage.</li>
</ol>
